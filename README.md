Dataset: LLM Code Quality Benchmark (ISEC 2026)

This repository contains the dataset, generated code solutions, and evaluation artifacts used in the paper:

From Correctness to Code Quality: Formalizing Software Engineering Metrics for Evaluating General LLMs
Accepted at ISEC 2026 (Innovations in Software Engineering Conference)

The dataset enables reproducible evaluation of LLM-generated code beyond functional correctness, incorporating multiple software engineering (SE) quality dimensions.
